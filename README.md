## SwarmUI

![Containers](/dashboards.png)
SwarmUI is a web interface for the Docker and Swarm Remote API. The goal is to provide a pure client side implementation so it is effortless to connect and manage docker. This project is based on [DockerUI](https://github.com/crosbymichael/dockerui) project, and is not complete. This's still under heavy development.
